```

#### 2. Multi-Method Watermark Detection
```python
# Combines pattern detection, statistical analysis, and frequency analysis
watermark_score = (pattern_score + statistical_score + frequency_score) / 3
```

#### 3. Hierarchical Source Attribution
```python
# Progressive classification from family → model → version
family_logits = family_classifier(features)
model_logits = model_classifier(features + family_features)
version_logits = version_classifier(features + family_features + model_features)
```
